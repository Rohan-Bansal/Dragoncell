## How to Play

*Tutorial also in-game*

The UI consists of three windows:

 1. Inventory
 2. Materials Book
 3. Machine/Collection View
 
 The inventory stores items that have been collected or created in the collection view window.

The materials book stores information about various materials as well as their crafting recipes for various machines such as the workbench, the forge, and the presser.

The machine/collection view can switch between machines at a click of a button, such as from the workbench to the forge, or the forge to the world view. The world view contains your character, and this is where you can collect materials.


The game ends when **you craft the dragoncell and use it to escape the planet**
